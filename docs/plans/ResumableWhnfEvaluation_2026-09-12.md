# Resumable WHNF Evaluation Plan — 2026-09-12

Status: W0 and W1A complete on 2026-09-12; W1B-W8 planned. This is the focused implementation plan selected by
GCI11R-002D.2c.1d in
[`GarbageCollectorAggressiveVerificationRemediation_2026-09-11.md`](GarbageCollectorAggressiveVerificationRemediation_2026-09-11.md).
Production trampoline cutover has not begun; W1A installs only its
crate-private protocol vocabulary and evaluation-boundary adapter.

## Purpose

Replace the recursive evaluator's implicit Rust-stack continuation with one
crate-private, resumable weak-head-normal-form computation.

Today `eval_value_in` and its callees may discover a lazy, promise, reflection
gate, net dependency, or host boundary after performing part of a larger pure
calculation. A retryable `EvaluationHalt` retains the dependency, but not the
calculation state which must consume its result. The enclosing scheduled
machine either keeps that state accidentally on the Rust call stack while it
cooperatively pumps the dependency or retries from a coarser machine state.
The latter can repeat completed prefixes, construct fresh semantic lazies, and
fail to make progress.

The target is a fine-grained trampoline for **evaluation to outer WHNF**. It is
not another effect interpreter. Reflection and other freer-effect handlers
retain their existing monadic machines and host one WHNF subcomputation when
they need a value demanded.

This transition has two inseparable motives:

1. suspension must resume after the completed prefix rather than restart from
   an initial value or enclosing effect branch; and
2. ordinary pure evaluation must eventually consume an explicit work budget
   without growing the Rust call stack with semantic depth.

## Current Failure Shape

Reflection request decoding currently performs this sequence in one Rust call
chain:

```text
drive reflection branch
  -> evaluate effect object
  -> evaluate `eff`
  -> apply `eff` to the reflection API
       -> saturated Glam application constructs lazy L
  -> evaluate L to obtain the request
  -> parse and dispatch the request
```

Function saturation ordinarily produces `LazySource::FunctionCall`, including
for a trivial effect such as `.r ()`. The reflection machine therefore
immediately demands a semantic lazy which its own request-decoding step just
constructed. `EvaluatorStepContext` gives that lazy an exact temporary owner,
and coordinator admission gives its producer durable ownership. Liveness and
producer ownership are not the defect.

The defect is the missing owner for **what request decoding must do after L
completes**. `reflection::MachineWork` retains only the coarser branch work.
When the recursive evaluator cannot finish L while its Rust callers remain
live, a resumed branch can apply `eff` again and construct L2 rather than
consume L's result. An uncommitted D.2c prototype forced this ordering and
produced an unbounded sequence of fresh lazy IDs.

The same representational gap applies below other recursive evaluator callers;
reflection merely supplied a small deterministic witness.

## Terminology

- **WHNF computation** — one request to follow a value's outer lazy and
  promised shells until it produces a non-deferred outer value, permanent
  failure, dependency, or budget yield.
- **regional quantum** — callback-free reduction performed while one matching
  `EvaluationValueAccess` is active.
- **durable checkpoint** — rooted evaluator state which can survive access
  closure, a scheduler handoff, another worker, cancellation, or collection.
- **delegation** — an immediate control transition saying that the current
  result is the result of another piece of WHNF work. It creates no wait,
  semantic lazy, cache write, or machine-specific continuation.
- **dependency** — a scheduler-visible condition which currently prevents
  progress, such as a wait token or unassigned promise.
- **resumption state** — the exact computation state after the completed
  prefix. This is mathematically a defunctionalized continuation, but the
  implementation need not use closures or a general frame vector.
- **result disposition** — what the outer owner does with completed WHNF: return
  it to a client, cache it in a lazy, parse it as a reflection request, inspect
  it for a spark, or feed it into another existing machine.

## Selected Architecture

### One reusable WHNF submachine

Introduce a crate-private stateful computation with a shape resembling:

```rust
struct WhnfComputation {
    checkpoint: DurableWhnfState,
}

enum WhnfPoll {
    Ready(RuntimeValueRoot),
    Pending(WhnfDependency),
    Yielded,
    Failed(RuntimeFailureRoot),
}
```

The exact spellings and whether failure is rooted by this layer remain
implementation details. The required property is structural: after `Pending`
or `Yielded`, the same `WhnfComputation` contains the exact state to poll next.
The dependency alone is never treated as a sufficient resumption record.

An outer machine owns the `WhnfComputation`. Polling temporarily projects its
durable state beneath one access region, performs bounded callback-free work,
then either completes or publishes a replacement durable checkpoint before
that access ends. Scheduler admission, waits, callbacks, reflection
activation, and claim release occur only after the access region has closed.

### Pure progress and orchestration remain distinct

The regional reducer reports transitions resembling:

```rust
enum RegionalWhnfStep {
    Delegate(RegionalWhnfWork),
    Ready(Value),
    Boundary(RegionalBoundaryRequest),
    Failed(Arc<EvaluationFailure>),
}
```

`Delegate` replaces the current work and continues within the same result
destination. `Boundary` first packages the current work into a durable
checkpoint. A mutator-free driver then translates the request into existing
lazy, promise, reflection, net, or host coordination.

This division describes pure **semantics**, not an assertion that WHNF never
depends on external work. A reflection annotation or host-backed source may
interrupt a pure demand. The reducer stops at that boundary; it does not
interpret the external operation while retaining managed access.

### `LazySource` remains a recipe, not a program counter

`LazySource` continues to describe the immutable semantic recipe owned by one
lazy and discarded only after terminal cache publication. The initial
implementation must not replace that source with partially executed variants
or construct a new semantic lazy merely to hold evaluator control state.

Resumable source work retains the source's stable lazy owner plus separate
progress. W0B found only two true tail demands among 305 relevant control-flow
occurrences, versus 157 demand-then-inspect sites and 95 more application,
collection, key, and path shapes. Source-specific phases alone would therefore
duplicate the same child-resumption protocol across most evaluator modules.

The selected representation is a shared explicit work stack:

```rust
struct RegionalWhnfWork {
    focus: Value,
    frames: Vec<RegionalWhnfFrame>,
}

enum RegionalWhnfStep {
    Delegate(Value),
    Continue(RegionalWhnfWork),
    Ready(Value),
    Boundary(RegionalBoundaryRequest),
    Failed(Arc<EvaluationFailure>),
}
```

`Delegate` remains a direct focus replacement and does not push a frame.
Repeated nested work uses shared frames for demand-and-inspect, ordered
operands, collection walks, application, key conversion, access paths, and
diagnostic context. Orchestration handoff is a boundary result rather than an
evaluator frame. A source or operation may still own a small phase enum when
it has genuinely unique state, but it resumes child WHNF through the common
stack rather than reproducing another evaluator.

Regional frames contain raw values only while one managed-access region is
active. Their durable counterparts contain matching-runtime roots only for
the focus and frame fields which cross a yield, suspension, or callback. W1
may use a plain `Vec` initially; inline capacity and root-frame compression are
profiling work, not correctness prerequisites.

### Durable state is rooted only at real boundaries

Do not register a root for every delegation, recursive call, operand, or
intermediate value. During a regional quantum, the active mutator protects raw
working values. Roots are constructed only for state which must outlive that
region: suspension, budget yield, callback handoff, or publication.

Checkpoint replacement follows this order:

1. enter with the prior durable checkpoint still live;
2. project it beneath matching access;
3. perform local work using raw/scoped values;
4. root every live value in the replacement checkpoint before access closes;
5. install the replacement checkpoint; and
6. only then retire superseded roots and perform external coordination.

Panic/unwind handling must never leave a machine with an empty checkpoint.
Keeping the prior checkpoint until replacement publication is acceptable even
if unwind ultimately terminalizes the owning machine.

The first correct implementation may use one registered root per value live
across a real suspension. A future root-frame facility may compress
machine-adjacent roots; this plan must not invent that concurrent-GC mechanism
or add root traffic to the ordinary non-suspending path in anticipation of it.

### Result destinations stay outside pure evaluation

`WhnfComputation` returns WHNF; it does not decide where that result belongs.

- `ClientDemandOperation` publishes it to the client-demand sink.
- `LazyTaskMachine` verifies non-deferred WHNF and installs the terminal lazy
  cache.
- `PromiseFollower` publishes/follows the assigned value according to its
  existing coordinator role.
- the spark driver discards the result after fulfilling best-effort demand.
- the reflection machine interprets it according to a small
  `ReflectionWhnfPurpose` or equivalent phase.
- net construction and cursor-WHNF retain their existing pollable machines and
  topology-owned progress.

In particular, delegation does not immediately write a lazy result. Only the
outer `LazyTaskMachine` which owns that cache may publish it.

### Reflection hosts rather than duplicates the trampoline

The reflection effect machine remains responsible for `.alt`, `.cut`,
transactions, request dispatch, and effect continuations. Its monolithic
request-decoding helpers must be split only enough to retain a WHNF
subcomputation and the purpose of its result:

```rust
MachineWork::EvaluateWhnf {
    computation: WhnfComputation,
    purpose: ReflectionWhnfPurpose,
    branch: Branch<_>,
    scope_depth: usize,
}
```

The exact representation may instead be a dedicated request-decoding state.
The semantic requirement is that resuming request evaluation consumes the
same application lazy and continues at request parsing; it must not replay the
preceding branch application.

### Budgeting is part of the target contract

Every iterative transition consumes a finite work unit. Collection walks and
other loops which may scale with user data consume additional units rather
than hiding unbounded work inside one nominal step. Budget exhaustion packages
the exact state and produces `Yielded`, not a fabricated dependency.

Existing task machines already understand yielding. Client demand and spark
adapters must gain an equivalent requeue disposition if their WHNF work can
exhaust a quantum. Direct synchronous adapters loop over yields through the
ordinary runtime driver rather than recursively evaluating.

The initial accounting need only be deterministic and monotonic; precise cost
weighting and adaptive scheduling are performance work.

## Preliminary Current-State Inventory

Phase W0 makes this inventory exact and source-backed. The preliminary survey
identifies these distinct owners and computation shapes.

### Outer owners

| Owner | Current state | Target relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ClientDemandOperation` | Retains only the initial `RuntimeValueRoot`; each poll calls `eval_value_in` again. | Own one `WhnfComputation`; publish only `Ready`/`Failed`. |
| `LazyTaskMachine` | `Produce`, `Follow`, `HostCall`, or `NetConstruction`; ordinary source evaluation is recursive. | Host source computation; retain cache publication as the outer disposition. |
| `PromiseFollower` | Retains promise root plus assignment/follow phase. | Reuse or host WHNF assignment demand without losing canonical dependency behavior. |
| spark polling | Reprojects the original value and retries the strategy operation. | Retain resumable best-effort WHNF work; yield or park without fabricating completion. |
| reflection `MachineWork` | Persistent effect phases, but calls recursive `evaluate_in` inside individual phases. | Host a WHNF submachine plus a reflection-specific completion purpose. |
| interaction-net normalization | Already owns explicit `NetDriverWorklist`; operator evaluation can surface semantic dependencies. | Preserve the net worklist and bridge only its evaluator suboperations. |
| net construction | Already owns `NetConstructionMachine`. | Preserve it as an orchestration boundary; do not translate it into evaluator frames. |
| direct/test evaluator adapters | Keep recursive Rust calls alive while cooperatively pumping. | Drive the same WHNF submachine synchronously; remain compatibility-only where already planned. |

### Lazy sources

| Source | Principal resumption concern |
| --- | --- |
| `Error` | Permanent invariant failure; no progress state. |
| `ComputedFixpoint` | Application followed by demand, or object construction; retain the marker and post-application phase. |
| `SemanticComputation` | A function pointer can currently hide arbitrary recursive evaluator work; production uses must be converted to explicit inspectable work or proven nonsuspending. |
| test `SemanticThunk` | Opaque closure cannot package arbitrary locals; remove from suspension verification or constrain it to a classified boundary fixture. |
| `HostCall` | Already invoked outside evaluator access; preserve explicit callback handoff and feed its rooted result into WHNF work. |
| `ReflectionTask` | Reservation, activation, polling, acknowledgement, context attachment, and target projection straddle the access boundary. |
| `Access` | Iterates static/dynamic path parts and demands intermediate dictionaries; retain path/dynamic indices and current value. |
| `Application` | May demand a deferred function, apply multiple arguments, and demand a resulting lazy; retain argument position and current function. |
| `Builtin` | Dispatches to the recurring unary, multi-operand, collection-fold, application, and boundary shapes below. |
| `NetConstruction` | Already has a pollable effect machine; retain as an outer lazy-task mode. |
| `NetComputation` | Cursor-WHNF has explicit work state; preserve its special contention proof and result context. |
| `FunctionCall` | Net attachment plus cursor-WHNF extraction; preserve attached runtime and exposed interface after construction. |

### Recurring pure call shapes

1. tail demand or delegation through lazy/promised aliases;
2. demand one child, inspect its WHNF kind, then construct a result;
3. demand fixed operands in order, then combine them;
4. demand elements of a list/dictionary fold while preserving an index and
   accumulator;
5. demand a function, apply one or more arguments, and optionally demand the
   result;
6. recursively convert lists/dictionaries into `Key` values;
7. walk access paths while demanding each intermediate dictionary;
8. attach structured diagnostic context if a nested demand fails; and
9. hand a fully rooted request to reflection, host, net, or scheduler work and
   later consume its response.

The exact frequency and nesting of these shapes determine the W0C progress
representation.

## Semantic and Safety Invariants

1. `Pending` and `Yielded` retain the exact computation state after every
   completed prefix; callers never reconstruct it from the initial value.
2. A resumed operation observes the same semantic lazy, promise, application,
   path position, and already-computed operands it observed before suspension.
3. A dependency is scheduler state, not an evaluation failure. Only permanent
   failures may enter lazy caches, promise failures, wait terminals, or
   failure ledgers.
4. Delegation changes evaluator control only. It creates no semantic lazy,
   promise, wait, task, cache entry, or externally observable identity.
5. `LazySource` remains the immutable semantic recipe. Evaluator progress is
   separate and machine-local.
6. Only the owner of a result destination may publish it. The pure reducer
   cannot cache into an arbitrary lazy or complete an outer task.
7. No `EvaluationValueAccess`, `RuntimeValueAccess`, mutator, raw `Value`, or
   unrooted `Gc<T>` survives a regional quantum.
8. Every value retained across a boundary has one exact matching-runtime root
   or another already-reviewed durable owner.
9. Ordinary non-suspending delegation adds no root registration, lock,
   reference-count update, scheduler admission, or semantic allocation.
10. No wait, coordinator transition, arbitrary Rust callback, reflection
    launcher, task poll, or worker sleep occurs under managed access.
11. Work sharing remains canonical. Resumption does not evaluate a fresh copy
    merely because another worker owned the original dependency.
12. Lazy cache publication continues to reject a deferred outer shell;
    assigned promises may retain one and WHNF follows it through ordinary
    demand.
13. Existing pure-lazy cycle detection and promise-inclusive retry semantics
    remain coordinator properties; the trampoline neither poisons temporary
    promise cycles nor creates a second dependency graph.
14. Reflection reservation and activation remain once-only and
    observer-independent. Resumption cannot launch or acknowledge the same
    task twice.
15. Failure context accumulated before and after a suspension has the same
    order and shape as uninterrupted evaluation.
16. Raw `Value::Net` remains already in WHNF. Only explicit net computation,
    function application, or interaction-net operations initiate net work.
17. Cursor-WHNF's bracketed contention wait remains its narrow structural
    exception; it does not authorize general evaluator waits under a mutator.
18. Every unbounded semantic recursion or collection loop beneath WHNF is
    either converted into iterative work or recorded as a named deferred
    exception before this plan closes.
19. A poll budget yields deterministically from an exact checkpoint. It never
    changes semantic results or becomes an observable source of failure.
20. Concurrent-ordering fixes are verified with controlled probes, barriers,
    channels, or model checking. Repetition is stress evidence only.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the reflection freer-effect machine or changing `.alt`, `.cut`,
  transaction, or task semantics.
- Turning evaluator progress into a Glam value or public API.
- Making `LazySource` mutable, serializable, or observable through reflection.
- Using reference counts to infer exclusive ownership of a freshly constructed
  lazy.
- Constructing a semantic lazy or promise solely to hold evaluator control
  state.
- Introducing a root frame, moving collection, concurrent collection, or a
  new GC barrier.
- Optimizing work-unit weights, frame layouts, small-vector capacity, or JIT
  execution before profiling.
- Controlling recursion outside semantic WHNF evaluation, such as parser or
  diagnostic-renderer recursion.
- Replacing the existing interaction-net and net-construction worklists with a
  generic evaluator stack.

## Transition Phases

Execute and verify one named checkpoint at a time. Mark its status and add its
completion record to this plan in the same commit as the implementation it
describes. Repartition a checkpoint before implementation if its inventory or
diff is materially larger than anticipated; checkpoint names are coordination
tools, not a reason to land an oversized change.

### Phase W0 — Baseline, Exact Inventory, and Representation Gate

#### W0A — Deterministic replay witness

Status: complete on 2026-09-12.

Add a test-only boundary probe which forces request decoding to yield after
the freshly constructed effect-application lazy has acquired durable producer
ownership but before that producer completes. Complete the producer, resume
the parent, and observe the current replay from coarse `MachineWork` before
landing the fix.

W0A records the current inverse identity/count assertion. When W5D repairs
the same fixture, it must assert:

- the same lazy identity is consumed after resumption;
- the effect application is constructed once;
- the reflection task is reserved and activated once;
- request parsing occurs after the forced resumption; and
- the result of `anno { refl:.r () } "ready"` remains `"ready"`.

Do not replace the forced ordering with repeated worker runs.

Completion record: a one-shot test boundary now arms only after reflection
request decoding constructs its effect-application lazy. The test receives
that exact wait through a channel, gives the parent one poll, independently
completes the producer, and then resumes the parent. It characterizes the
current defect as two distinct application-lazy identities while proving the
nested `anno {refl:(.r ())} "ready"` task launches once and the final value is
still `"ready"`. This is intentionally a passing baseline of the broken
coarse-replay behavior; W5D reverses its identity/count assertions when the
production trampoline is installed.

#### W0B — Exact suspension and recursion census

Status: complete on 2026-09-12.

Build a source-backed manifest of every production call beneath `src/eval`
and every reflection/protocol adapter which can:

- call `eval_value_in`, `eval_lazy_in`, `eval_promised_in`, `apply_value_in`,
  `apply_values_in`, `produce_lazy_source_in`, `evaluate_in`, or an equivalent
  recursive evaluator helper;
- construct `EvaluationHalt::blocked` or
  `EvaluationHalt::unassigned_root`;
- translate a retryable halt into `WorkDependency`;
- call a scheduler/coordinator operation, callback, reflection launcher, net
  wait, or task poll; or
- recurse structurally over user-sized list, dictionary, path, operand, or
  application data.

Classify each occurrence by outer owner, result disposition, stable semantic
owner, dependency kind, remaining work, context/error behavior, and one of the
nine preliminary call shapes. Reconcile rather than duplicate the parent
D.2c raw-value and mutator-introduction manifests.

Verification: exact declaration fingerprints and per-family counts fail on an
unclassified addition or move. Deliberately misclassify one tail demand and
one nested post-demand operation, prove failure, then restore them.

Completion record: [`src/eval/whnf_inventory.rs`](../../src/eval/whnf_inventory.rs)
parses the production evaluator plus the narrow reflection and coordinator
adapters with `syn`. Every matching call or loop records its declaration,
ordinal, signal, outer owner, result disposition, stable semantic owner,
dependency kind, remaining-work shape, and context behavior. The exact
baseline is 305 occurrences with fingerprint
`0xbfae81b963836039` (`13_812_119_740_430_377_017`). The signal totals are:

| Signal family | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| value/lazy/promise demand | 110 |
| value application and source production | 29 |
| reflection-local evaluation | 17 |
| retryable halt and dependency translation | 16 |
| coordinator/reflection/host/net boundary | 47 |
| structural recursion | 24 |
| conservatively inventoried loops | 62 |

The reviewed resumption shapes are:

| Remaining-work shape | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| tail demand | 2 |
| demand then inspect | 157 |
| ordered operands | 4 |
| collection walk | 45 |
| application | 11 |
| key conversion | 23 |
| access path | 12 |
| diagnostic context | 1 |
| orchestration handoff | 50 |

The census deliberately includes loops conservatively: W6/W7 may prove a
particular balanced or statically bounded loop exempt, but new unreviewed work
cannot silently disappear from the inventory. Its classification validator is
also tested with forced tail-to-nested and nested-to-tail substitutions.

#### W0C — Progress representation decision

Status: complete on 2026-09-12.

Use the census to select the smallest complete representation:

- prefer source/operation-specific phases when they contain the entire
  remaining computation without duplication;
- introduce a shared compact frame only for a repeated nested resumption shape;
- use a frame vector or linked frame representation only if arbitrary nesting
  cannot otherwise be expressed without replay or a proliferation of
  equivalent phase enums; and
- preserve an iterative `Delegate` transition in every option.

Record the selected work variants, their durable roots, work-unit accounting,
size observations, and unwind behavior in this plan before production
conversion. Include a compile-exhaustive fixture over the selected variants.

Decision record: use one shared regional work stack with a separate durable
checkpoint form. Its selected vocabulary is `Delegate`, demand-and-inspect,
ordered operands, collection walk, application, key conversion, access path,
diagnostic context, and orchestration handoff. The test inventory contains an
exhaustive match over those nine variants so additions require an explicit
decision update.

The durable root policy is exact rather than uniform: the current focus has
one root; a frame roots only captured `Value` fields needed after its child
returns; indexes, enum tags, keys, counts, and immutable operation descriptors
remain immediate. Application and collection frames initially root each
retained semantic value independently. A later root-frame facility may pack
those roots without changing the work algebra.

Every focus transition, frame push/pop, child result delivery, and collection
element consumes at least one deterministic work unit. A `Delegate` consumes
one unit but performs no allocation or root registration. Boundary checkpoint
packing is charged to the transition which discovers it; W7 may tune weights,
but no user-sized loop may hide behind one unit.

The x86-64 bootstrap currently observes `Value = 64` bytes,
`RuntimeValueRoot = 32` bytes, and `Vec<Value> = 24` bytes. These are planning
observations, not ABI or regression latches. They favor keeping regional raw
values out of roots during uninterrupted work and deferring inline-frame or
packed-root optimization until profiling.

Unwind retains the prior durable checkpoint until a replacement is fully
rooted and installed. A panic during regional work discards only transient raw
state while the owner still has its prior checkpoint; the owning machine then
terminalizes or poisons according to its existing boundary policy. No empty
or half-published checkpoint is observable.

Exit: the failing ordering is reproducible, every relevant caller has one
owner, and the state shape is selected from evidence rather than assumed.

### Phase W1 — Additive WHNF Submachine

#### W1A — Protocol and module boundary

Status: complete on 2026-09-12.

Add the crate-private `WhnfComputation`, regional work/step, durable checkpoint,
dependency/boundary, and poll result types without changing production entry
points. Place semantic reduction with `eval`; keep coordinator translation in
the existing evaluation boundary. Do not make `WhnfComputation` a `Value`,
`LazySource`, public type, or `EvaluationTaskMachine`.

Compile-time/source checks must reject raw values and active access in durable
state. Size checks should observe rather than freeze representation unless a
specific regression threshold is justified.

Completion record: [`src/eval/whnf.rs`](../../src/eval/whnf.rs) now owns the
additive crate-private protocol. `WhnfComputation` retains a durable rooted
checkpoint; `RegionalWhnfWork` and `RegionalWhnfStep` describe callback-free
work beneath managed access; `WhnfPoll` exposes completion, dependency,
budget-yield, and rooted-failure outcomes. The seven caller-frame kinds are
kept distinct from tail `Delegate` and orchestration `Boundary` transitions,
so neither transition requires a synthetic stack frame.

[`src/evaluation/whnf.rs`](../../src/evaluation/whnf.rs) is the sole W1A
adapter from semantic `WhnfDependency` to coordinator `WorkDependency`.
Source-backed checks keep the protocol crate-private, absent from `Value`,
`LazySource`, `EvaluationTaskMachine`, and current production entry points,
and reject raw `Value` or active-access fields in durable state. The W0B
census scope now includes this evaluation-boundary module.

The x86-64 bootstrap observes `WhnfComputation = 56` bytes,
`DurableWhnfState = 56`, `DurableWhnfFrame = 40`,
`RegionalWhnfWork = 88`, `RegionalWhnfFrame = 40`,
`WhnfDependency = 40`, and `WhnfPoll = 48`. These are recorded observations,
not ABI assertions or regression thresholds. W1A intentionally implements no
polling or regional reduction; W1B first exercises that protocol with its
synthetic algebra before W1C adds checkpoint projection.

#### W1B — Synthetic delegation and resumption

Implement a minimal test work algebra covering immediate completion, tail
delegation, nested post-demand work, permanent failure, dependency suspension,
and budget yield. Prove that:

- delegation is iterative and allocation-free;
- a forced dependency resumes at the recorded phase;
- a yield requires no dependency;
- no completed prefix is executed twice; and
- failure context before/after suspension remains ordered.

This fixture tests the state-machine protocol before real lazy scheduling can
obscure a protocol defect.

#### W1C — Regional-to-durable checkpoint publication

Implement the access-scoped projection and replacement protocol. Add probes
which verify root construction precedes access closure and every scheduler or
callback action follows it. Exercise cancellation and panic/unwind with a
nonempty prior checkpoint.

Under `aggressive-gc-verification`, collect between two polls and prove that
every live checkpoint value survives while superseded state becomes
collectible after retirement.

Exit: a scheduler-independent WHNF submachine can delegate, yield, suspend,
resume, complete, and fail without Rust-stack continuation state.

### Phase W2 — Deferred Shell Demand and Client Ownership

#### W2A — Regional lazy inspection

Split lazy demand into callback-free cache/source inspection and mutator-free
producer coordination. An uncached lazy returns its exact `ManagedLazyRoot` as
a boundary request; it does not reserve, pump, wait, or wake under access.
After access closes, the driver reuses or admits the canonical producer and
records the returned dependency in the same `WhnfComputation`.

On wake, reproject the same lazy and inspect its cache. Do not snapshot and
reconstruct a replacement `LazyValue` owner.

#### W2B — Promise inspection and following

Split promise assignment inspection from promise-follower admission. Preserve:

- direct retryable observation of an unassigned resolver promise;
- the task-owned self-observation diagnostic;
- canonical follower work for assigned deferred values;
- same-runtime cross-session observation; and
- permanent producer failure/abandonment rules.

Whichever parts of `PromiseFollower` remain separate must host or delegate to
the same WHNF submachine rather than restart assignment evaluation.

#### W2C — Client-demand cutover

Replace `ClientDemandOperation(RuntimeValueRoot)` with an operation owning one
initialized `WhnfComputation`. Add an explicit yielded client-demand
disposition and requeue it without dependency subscription. Blocked demand
retains both its exact subscription and unchanged computation checkpoint.

Retirement publishes only terminal WHNF/failure and drops the computation
outside coordinator locks.

#### W2D — Direct driver compatibility

Make synchronous assembler/test demand drive the same client/WHNF path.
Remove recursive cooperative pumping from the selected entry rather than
building a second trampoline. A synchronous caller may wait for claimed work
only through the existing mutator-free client-demand driver.

#### W2E — Deferred-demand verification

Force both producer-before-subscription and subscription-before-producer
completion orderings. Cover cached/uncached lazy, assigned/unassigned promise,
cross-session producer, cancellation, abandonment, pure lazy cycle, and
promise-inclusive retryable cycle. Record root registration and producer
admission counts across each boundary.

Mandatory post-W2 review: audit correctness and later-phase drift before
converting lazy-source production.

### Phase W3 — Lazy Producers and Source Progress

#### W3A — Lazy task result disposition

Make `LazyTaskMachine` own one source-oriented `WhnfComputation` for ordinary
semantic sources. Keep terminal cache publication in `LazyTaskMachine` and
prove that `Ready` contains no deferred outer shell. Replace the specialized
`Follow` loop with general delegation only when that preserves the same cache
owner and dependency graph.

`HostCall` and `NetConstruction` remain explicit outer modes until W4.

#### W3B — Application and computed fixpoint sources

Convert `LazySource::Application`, `FunctionCall`, and `ComputedFixpoint` into
phase-aware work. Preserve partial application, exact argument order,
function-stage sharing, fixpoint marker identity, object fixpoint behavior,
and the rule that only saturation creates memoized function work.

Add a forced suspension after every phase and assert no function application,
net attachment, or fixpoint marker is rebuilt after resumption.

#### W3C — Access and key/list source work

Convert dynamic path evaluation, intermediate dictionary demand, recursive
key conversion, lazy list chunks, and sequence projections. Retain explicit
path/collection indices and accumulators. Missing dictionary members remain
`{}`; type mismatches and index errors retain their current structured
contexts.

#### W3D — Semantic computation representation

Inventory the production `SemanticComputation` function-pointer uses. Replace
every suspendable use with an explicit inspectable operation/work variant.
Keep a function pointer only when the operation is proved regional,
nonsuspending, and bounded, or retire the representation entirely.

The test-only opaque `SemanticThunk` may not serve as evidence for resumable
production work. Either constrain it to nonsuspending fixtures or replace it
with explicit synthetic work.

Exit: ordinary lazy production no longer depends on a Rust-stack continuation
across deferred children.

### Phase W4 — External and Existing Pollable Boundaries

#### W4A — Reflection lazy sources

Split reflection-source recognition/target projection from reservation,
activation, polling, acknowledgement, and failure propagation. Retain the
once-only reservation observation and first-observer activation permit.

The WHNF checkpoint must identify whether it awaits gate completion or a
returned value. A completed gate delegates to its existing target; a returned
value delegates to the task result. Neither path creates a replacement
reflection computation.

#### W4B — Host-call sources

Preserve `HostCallRootBundle` as the callback handoff. Package source progress,
close managed access, invoke exactly once, validate the returned runtime, and
feed the rooted result back into the same WHNF computation. A callback is
never replayed merely because its result is lazy or because evaluation yields.

Opaque host callbacks remain nonsuspendable Rust calls; making them
asynchronous is deferred work.

#### W4C — Net construction and net computation

Host the existing `NetConstructionMachine`, `NormalizationRequest`, and
`NetDriverWorklist` rather than translating their internal state into WHNF
frames. Bridge their terminal value/failure/dependency back into the enclosing
WHNF computation.

Preserve cursor-WHNF's local claim containment, disturbance wait, fallback
restoration, and no-materialization observation rules. A blocked core operator
retains both the net-owned call state and the evaluator checkpoint needed to
finish that operator.

#### W4D — Boundary verification

Force callback-before/after-yield, reflection activation races, net operator
dependency, and net-construction suspension. Verify exactly-once callback and
reservation counts, stable net work identities, and collection between every
handoff.

Mandatory post-W4 review: verify that the pure submachine has not absorbed
effect-handler or interaction-net lifecycle policy.

### Phase W5 — Reflection Machine Integration

#### W5A — WHNF submachine work state

Add a reflection work variant or dedicated decoding substate which owns
`WhnfComputation` plus one explicit completion purpose. It must compose with
branch cloning, cuts, retries, exits, cancellation, and transaction scopes
without cloning a live WHNF computation into multiple committed owners.

If an `.alt` branch needs independent evaluation, it receives an independently
rooted checkpoint by the existing branch construction policy; do not make
`WhnfComputation: Clone` as a shortcut.

#### W5B — Effect request decoding phases

Split effect-object, function, application-result, and request parsing into
explicit reflection phases. Preserve the existing structured
`effect_dispatch` contexts for `function`, `application`, and `request`.

Applying `eff` may produce a lazy, but the application occurs once. Request
parsing begins only after that same lazy produces WHNF.

#### W5C — Remaining reflection demand sites

Migrate task assertions, continuations, request payloads, keys, paths, stacks,
and protocol `.eval` requests currently using local `evaluate_in` loops.
Classify each as WHNF submachine work or a proven already-WHNF projection.
Remove the local recursive `evaluate_in` helper after its final caller moves.

#### W5D — Replay and branch verification

Land the W0A regression as a passing test. Add forced suspension to a nested
reflection request, a failing request with contexts, and alternative branches.
Assert exact lazy construction, task reservation, request dispatch, and
diagnostic counts.

Exit: reflection may suspend at any WHNF request boundary without replaying
the enclosing effect phase.

### Phase W6 — Complete Pure Evaluator Conversion

These checkpoints are the control-flow counterpart of the parent D.2c raw
value/access migration. Perform each family once: a D.2c checkpoint which
needs resumable demand adopts the WHNF work form here rather than retaining a
temporary recursive wrapper for a later pass.

#### W6A — Application and sequences

Convert the complete application and sequence families. Preserve currying,
applicative dictionary behavior, list order, binary/list streaming boundaries,
and non-forcing constructors.

#### W6B — Operators and runtime nets

Convert operator descriptors/execution and the remaining runtime-net evaluator
bridges. Keep topology and claim state in their existing net owners.

#### W6C — Dispatch, scalars, comparisons, and strategies

Convert builtin dispatch, arity/assertion/conditional operations, numeric and
comparison operands, `seq`, `spark`, and provenance boundaries. Operations
which require only immediate data should become immediate-data helpers rather
than artificial WHNF frames.

#### W6D — Dictionaries, lists, and patterns

Convert collection and pattern families, including collection folds and view
or predicate application. Preserve `.fail` mismatch semantics separately from
permanent evaluation failure.

#### W6E — Annotations and effect values

Convert pure annotations, reflection/strategy annotation recognition, general
effect construction, and list-effect helpers. Preserve sealed metadata and
the distinction between pure metadata updates and reflection boundaries.

#### W6F — Objects and interaction-net builtins

Convert object construction, C3/identity validation, and the remaining
interaction-net builtin request construction. Preserve referential-spec
validation and source-owned net journals.

Each W6 checkpoint updates the exact W0B and parent D.2c manifests, runs its
focused suites in ordinary and `aggressive-gc-verification` modes, and adds a
forced suspension after at least one representative child demand.

Mandatory post-W6 review: audit the complete converted call graph before
retiring compatibility entry points.

### Phase W7 — Stack and Budget Closure

#### W7A — Recursive-call elimination audit

Reduce the W0B manifest to zero unapproved recursive WHNF calls. Any remaining
Rust recursion must be one of:

- statically bounded representation plumbing;
- balanced persistent-container traversal with a documented logarithmic
  depth bound; or
- a separately owned worklist/trampoline such as cursor-WHNF.

No user-controlled semantic recursion may remain implicit on the Rust stack.

#### W7B — Small-stack verification

Run deterministic deep lazy-alias, promise-alias, application, access-path,
key-conversion, collection, fixpoint, and structured-failure fixtures in a
thread with a deliberately small Rust stack. Include both uninterrupted and
forced-suspension forms. Success must not depend on worker count or repeated
runs.

#### W7C — Budget and fairness verification

Prove that a deep computation yields after its exact budget, resumes from the
same checkpoint, and eventually completes. Ensure client demand, deferred
work, reflection, and sparks requeue yields without installing dependency
subscriptions or starving other ready work.

Observe root registrations, allocations, and poll counts. Treat them as
regression diagnostics initially, except enforce that uninterrupted tail
delegation performs no per-step root registration.

### Phase W8 — Compatibility Retirement and Documentation

#### W8A — Retire retryable recursive-halt transport

Remove `await_deferred_task`, the recursive blocked/unassigned-promise paths,
and adapters which translate a bare `EvaluationHalt` after losing evaluator
state. Decide from remaining callers whether `EvaluationHalt` becomes only a
permanent-failure carrier, aliases `EvaluationFailure`, or remains as a narrow
compatibility name. Do not preserve the union solely for obsolete call sites.

#### W8B — Retire direct evaluator compatibility

Remove the direct evaluator constructor and test wrappers made unnecessary by
the shared synchronous driver. Reconcile `EvaluationMachinePoll`, client
demand, spark, and reflection result boundaries with the final yielded/pending
protocol.

#### W8C — Inventory and documentation closure

Update:

- `docs/architecture/evaluation.md` with the current WHNF submachine flow;
- `docs/architecture/reflection.md` with hosted WHNF request decoding;
- `docs/agent_context/evaluation.md` with resumption and budgeting invariants;
- `src/README.md` with final module ownership;
- the parent D.2c completion records and raw-value manifests;
- the persistent-edge migration and Gate G3 prerequisites; and
- the GC ownership ledger for every new durable checkpoint root.

Remove chronological implementation detail from current architecture docs;
retain it in this plan's completion records and later review.

#### W8D — Full verification and review

Run:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test -q
cargo test -q --features aggressive-gc-verification
```

Run the selected Miri/model-checking subsets if the implementation adds new
unsafe or synchronization code. Ordinary WHNF state should require neither.

Then perform a dated review against every invariant and acceptance criterion
in this plan, including future-phase drift in D.2d-D.2g, P3-P5, and Gate G3.

## Verification Matrix

| Concern | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| reflection replay | Forced W0A ordering; same application lazy and one request dispatch after resumption. |
| lazy ownership | Exact temporary owner before admission, canonical producer root after admission, collectible state after completion. |
| promise following | Assigned/unassigned, resolver/task-owned, cross-session, abandonment, and promise-cycle cases. |
| exact resumption | Phase/counter probes showing no completed prefix executes twice. |
| delegation | Deep tail chain on a small Rust stack with no per-step semantic allocation or root registration. |
| budget yield | Exact deterministic yield count, no dependency subscription, fair requeue. |
| failure contexts | Equal structured context ordering with and without forced suspension. |
| callbacks | Host and reflection callbacks occur outside access and exactly once. |
| GC safety | Forced collection between every durable poll under `aggressive-gc-verification`. |
| work sharing | Two observers share one producer; the loser resumes through the same cached result. |
| cycle behavior | Pure lazy cycles fail canonically; promise-inclusive cycles remain retryable. |
| effects | Existing `.alt`, `.cut`, transaction, exit, and task semantics unchanged. |
| nets | Raw nets remain WHNF; cursor/net-construction worklists preserve identity and restoration. |
| stack control | User-controlled semantic depth completes on a deliberately small stack. |
| closure | Source-backed manifests show no unclassified recursive/suspendable WHNF entry. |

## Risks and Review Triggers

- If source-specific phases repeatedly encode the same nested return path,
  stop and adopt a compact shared frame rather than proliferating ad hoc
  continuations.
- If a general frame stack requires rooting values on every ordinary step,
  stop and repair the regional/durable split before proceeding.
- If preserving a computation across `.alt` appears to require `Clone`, review
  branch ownership rather than cloning active machine state.
- If a `LazySource` must be mutated to record progress, review whether the
  proposed state actually belongs to the lazy producer's machine.
- If an opaque production `SemanticComputation` or callback can suspend after
  W3D, halt for a representation decision; arbitrary Rust locals cannot be
  reconstructed safely.
- If a wait or callback appears to require retaining managed access, treat it
  as a boundary defect. Cursor-WHNF's separately proved structural wait is not
  a general precedent.
- If root registration scales with uninterrupted semantic depth, treat it as
  an architectural regression even if correctness tests pass.
- If stack closure would require converting unrelated balanced persistent
  data structures, record their actual depth bound rather than enlarging this
  plan without evidence.

## Completion Criteria

This plan is complete only when:

1. every WHNF suspension or yield retains an exact durable resumption state;
2. reflection request evaluation consumes the same intermediate lazy after a
   forced suspension and never replays the preceding application;
3. pure evaluation uses an iterative budgeted driver for all user-controlled
   semantic depth;
4. no mutator or raw managed value crosses scheduling, waiting, callbacks, or
   reflection activation;
5. uninterrupted delegation performs no per-step root registration;
6. outer machines alone own cache, task, branch, and client result
   dispositions;
7. every current retryable `EvaluationHalt` caller has moved to the stateful
   protocol or has a documented bounded exception;
8. deterministic suspension, cycle, callback, collection, and small-stack
   verification passes; and
9. a post-implementation review accounts for every deliberate or accidental
   departure from this plan.
